- Colors: Each player is assigned a distinct color, with Player 1 represented by red and Player 2 by black.
- Gameplay: Players take turns making moves, and the server determines the winner based on the game's rules.
- Reset: Players can initiate a new game by clicking the reset button on their client interface.
